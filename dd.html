  <h1>Do's And Dont's</h1>
  
  <h3>Do's</h3>
    
<h4> Use a nighttime face lotion.</h4>
    <p> There's evidence that skin-cell regeneration is faster at night than during the day, so take advantage of your skin's receptiveness. </p>
    <h4>Lavish your face and body with coffee topically.</h4>
    <p>Because of its qualities that signal tissue repair, coffee plays a crucial role in regulating cell re-growth, leading to retained hydration and increased skin elasticity.</p>
    <h4>Use mild formulas.</h4>
    <p>Everything you intend to put onto your face should provide it with some benefits. Cleansers should be soap-free. Think of it this way, you are cleansing your face to remove dirt, oil, fungus, sweat, bacteria and skin cells that have died, so you need to find something that is highly effective, yet gentle on your skin.</p>
    </ul>

    

<h3>Don'ts</h3>

<h4>Don’t Keep Touching Your Face</h4>
  <p>The truth is that the more you touch your face, the more problems will arise. Breakouts happen because of unclean hands full of bacteria when you touch your face. And, this acts as a fuel for the blemishes. At least try to keep your hands off your face as much as possible.</p>
<h4> Don’t Take Hot Showers</h4>
  <p>Even though hot showers are immensely relaxing and soothing, they are considered less than ideal for your skin. Taking a hot shower not only upsets your skin’s natural moisture balance, but it also strips the natural oils and proteins from your skin that keeps it healthy.</p>
<h4>When applying things to your skin:</h4>
  <p> Don’t drag and pull and tug. When cleaning, don’t scrub. Think of patting and tapping as a way to show your skin some love.</p>
</ul>
